Hi there! 👋
I’m Nicolas Cammareri, but today, let’s talk about the Infrastructure Engineer role and how it contrasts with my expertise as a FullStack Developer.

🔧 What is an Infrastructure Engineer?
An Infrastructure Engineer focuses on designing, implementing, and maintaining the foundational IT systems that support applications and services. Unlike a FullStack Developer, who builds applications, an Infrastructure Engineer ensures that those applications run smoothly, securely, and efficiently.
